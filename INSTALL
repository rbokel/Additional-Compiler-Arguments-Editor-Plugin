Usage 
If you doubleclick a .actionScriptProperties file, it should open in the new editor. 
If not, you might have registered another editor to this file. Right click the 
.actionScriptProperties file and use "open with" ActionScriptPropertiesEditor. 

The editor has two views. A xml view and a form view. You can switch the two views 
using the tabs at the bottom of the window. The xml editor is mainly for debugging. 
Try using the form editor and go back and forth to the xml view to check if the result 
looks ok.
